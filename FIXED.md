# 🎯 CRITICAL FIX APPLIED

## Problem

The authentication middleware was not properly extracting the `userId` from the JWT token, causing:

- ❌ All customer operations to fail with "userId is required" error
- ❌ Dashboard showing empty data (userId was undefined)
- ❌ POST /api/customers returning 500 error

## Root Cause

```javascript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
const decoded = jwt.verify(token, JWT_SECRET);
req.user = decoded; // Set user object, but no req.userId
// Result: req.userId was undefined
```

## Solution Applied

```javascript
// AFTER (FIXED):
const decoded = jwt.verify(token, JWT_SECRET);
req.user = decoded;
req.userId = decoded.userId; // ✅ Extract userId for easy access
```

## What This Fixes

✅ **Customer Creation**: Now properly saves customers with userId
✅ **Dashboard**: Now loads streets with correct userId filtering
✅ **Customer List**: Now shows customers filtered by userId
✅ **Reports**: Now calculates statistics for correct user
✅ **Data Isolation**: Each user now sees ONLY their own data

## Testing

1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. **Login** as your user
3. **Go to Data Entry** tab
4. **Add a test customer**:
   - Name: Test Customer
   - Box ID: TEST001
   - Street: Test Street
   - Amount: 500
5. **Click "Add Customer"**
6. **Check Dashboard** - Should now show 1 customer!

## Backend Logs to Verify

After adding a customer, you should see in backend terminal:

```
✅ Customer saved: { name: 'Test Customer', boxId: 'TEST001', streetName: 'Test Street', userId: '...' }
```

After the Dashboard loads:

```
🔍 GET /api/customers/streets - User ID: 67234abc...
📊 Streets found: 1
📦 Streets data: [{ name: 'Test Street', totalCustomers: 1, ... }]
```

## Status

🟢 **BACKEND RUNNING** on port 5001
🔧 **FIX APPLIED** - userId now properly extracted
✅ **READY TO TEST** - Try adding a customer now!
