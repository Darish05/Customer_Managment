# 🔧 Troubleshooting: Dashboard Shows Zero Data

## Problem

Dashboard is showing all zeros (0 customers, 0 paid, 0 unpaid, ₹0)

## Possible Causes

### 1. **You're a New User with No Data**

If you just registered, you have no customers yet!

**Solution:** Go to "Data Entry" tab and add customers.

---

### 2. **Old Customers Don't Have userId**

If you had customers BEFORE the userId update, they won't show up.

**Solution:** Run the migration script.

---

### 3. **Backend Not Running**

The backend server might not be running.

**Solution:** Start the backend.

---

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Diagnosis

### Step 1: Check Backend is Running

**Open PowerShell and run:**

```powershell
cd c:\Users\ADMIN\Desktop\customer-management-app\backend
node server.js
```

**You should see:**

```
✅ MongoDB Connected Successfully
🚀 Server running on port 5001
```

---

### Step 2: Check What's in Database

**Run this command:**

```powershell
cd c:\Users\ADMIN\Desktop\customer-management-app\backend
node checkDatabase.js
```

**This will show you:**

- How many users exist
- How many customers exist
- Which customers have userId
- Which customers need migration

---

### Step 3: Run Migration (If Needed)

**If checkDatabase.js shows customers WITHOUT userId:**

```powershell
cd c:\Users\ADMIN\Desktop\customer-management-app\backend
node migrateUserId.js
```

**This will:**

- Find the admin user
- Assign all old customers to admin
- Show you the results

---

### Step 4: Fresh Start (Alternative)

**If you want to start fresh:**

```powershell
cd c:\Users\ADMIN\Desktop\customer-management-app\backend
node clearDatabase.js
```

**Then:**

1. Register a new user
2. Login
3. Go to "Data Entry"
4. Add customers

## 🎯 Quick Test

### Test if Backend is Working:

**1. Open browser DevTools (F12)**

**2. Go to Console tab**

**3. Run this:**

```javascript
fetch("http://localhost:5001/api/customers/streets", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer " + localStorage.getItem("token"),
  },
})
  .then((r) => r.json())
  .then((data) => console.log("Streets:", data));
```

**Expected Result:**

- If you see an array → Backend is working
- If empty array `[]` → You have no customers
- If error → Backend not running or token issue

## 📝 Most Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Completely New User

```
1. You registered: john / john123
2. You logged in
3. Dashboard shows zeros

✅ This is NORMAL!
   Go to "Data Entry" and add customers.
```

### Scenario 2: Existing Data from Before

```
1. You had customers before the userId update
2. Now dashboard shows zeros

✅ Run migration:
   cd backend
   node migrateUserId.js

Then refresh browser.
```

### Scenario 3: Multiple Users

```
1. User A added customers
2. You're logged in as User B
3. Dashboard shows zeros

✅ This is CORRECT!
   Each user has separate data.
   User B needs to add their own customers.
```

4. Common errors:
   - `Failed to fetch` → Backend not running

   - `404 Not Found` → API endpoint issue

### Check Network Tab:

1. Press F12
2. Go to Network tab
3. Refresh page
4. Look for `/api/customers/streets` request
5. Check if it returns `200 OK`
6. Check the response data

## 💡 Understanding the Data Flow

```
Login as User A
     ↓
Token contains User A's ID
     ↓
Dashboard requests: GET /api/customers/streets
     ↓
Backend filters: userId === User A's ID
     ↓
Returns ONLY User A's streets
     ↓
If User A has no customers → Returns []
     ↓
Dashboard shows zeros
```

**This is how it's SUPPOSED to work!**

Each user has their own isolated data.
